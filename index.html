    <h1>The Formula Racing series and all about them</h1>
    <p>In this webpage, we will be looking into the Formula racing series and how to get to F1.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Go Karting</h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Alright. The first stage to getting to a profesional Racing series, such as F1, is go karting.<br>
        In order so start your go karting journey, you have to start  rental go karting. Basically, for part of the go karting stage, all you have to do is go to your local go karting track that allows you to borrow one of their go karts for a price.<br>
    After 1-2 years of this, you need to look for a team to sponsor or let you join their team.<br>
    But first, (depending on the karting Host you are trying to race in) you need to obtain a racing licence. To obtain his <em>licence,</em> you must contact your country's sporting authority (like karting australia or EMSO) to find out specific requirments and apply online or in person.<br>
    You generally need to complete an application, pass a medical examination, and may have to complete a <em>written</em> and/or <em>practical</em> test, depending on your age and experience.<br>
    Requirements vary by country and licence type, so always check with the issuing authority first.</h3> <img scr='Bahrain international karting circuit.jfif'> <br> <br> <br>


    <h2>Formula 4 (F4)</h2> <br>
    <br>
   <h3>To get from karting to F4, you need to <i>dominate Karting Championships obtain the right racing licence and training</i>,  develop professional racecraft (data analysis, team work), find significant funding/sponsorship, meet age/medical requirements (usually 15+), and then register for a national F4 series like British F4 or F4 Spain, progressing through driver schools and strong results. </h3><br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Formula 3 (F3)</h2><br>
    <br>
    <h3>To get from Formula 4 (F4) to Formula 3 (F3), you need to excel in F4 to earn an FIA International Licence, demonstrate significant talent and speed (like Max Verstappen skipping F4), secure budget/sponsorship, and impress F3 teams with your racecraft, often via junior academies or direct contact during the season. The path requires strong results, high performance, and proving you're ready for the faster, more powerful F3 cars, which are a major step up in downforce and speed from F4.</h3> <br>
